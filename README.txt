Hey there!

My name is Ben and I'm a local web developer from Brighton, Michigan. Looks like you found the GitHub project for my personal portfolio site, benterova.com.

There's really not that much interesting stuff to see back here, just some HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Just standard stuff.

Thanks for checking it out though!
